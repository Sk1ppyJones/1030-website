### Background

First off lets start with my background, I switched to computer science this  
semester after being an English Education major for awhile. Over spring break I  
finally accepted the fact that I no longer wanted to be a teacher (way to late in  
my opinion) and decided to go into CS because I always had a knack with computers  
and in highschool I did well in my classes with the subject.
