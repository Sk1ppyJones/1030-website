        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>First off lets start with my background, I switched to computer science this  
            semester after being an English Education major for awhile. Over spring break I  
            finally accepted the fact that I no longer wanted to be a teacher (way to late in  
            my opinion) and decided to go into CS because I always had a knack with computers  
            and in highschool I did well in my classes with the subject.</p>
