        <h1>Website for 1030</h1>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>First off lets start with my background, I switched to computer science<br>this  
            semester after being an English Education major for awhile. Over spring break<br>I  
            finally accepted the fact that I no longer wanted to be a<br>teacher (way to late in  
            my opinion) and decided to go into CS because<br>I always had a knack with computers  
            and, in highschool I did<br>well in my classes with the subject.</p>
        <p>I'm from Colorado, started living permanently in Utah in 7th grade. I went to NOJH<br>
        and then did one semester at Weber High before transferring to NUAMES North on the Ogden campus of WSU.</p>

        <h2>Free-Time</h2>
        <p>In my free time I spend most of my time playing video games, currently I<br>mostly play 
            <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/">Overwatch</a> and <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us">Minecraft.</a> Generally when I play I'm also watching<br>television. My favorite 
            show for the record is SyFy's <a href="https://www.syfy.com/the-magicians">The Magicians</a>, I have seen it like 20 times.<br>I'm also 
            technically a minecraft youtuber, not big or anything but I have fun making videos! </p>
