        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>First off lets start with my background, I switched to computer science<br>this  
            semester after being an English Education major for awhile. Over spring break<br>I  
            finally accepted the fact that I no longer wanted to be a<br>teacher (way to late in  
            my opinion) and decided to go into CS because<br>I always had a knack with computers  
            and, in highschool I did<br>well in my classes with the subject.</p>
