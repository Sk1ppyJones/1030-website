    ## Welcome to my website! In this we'll be talking about me and showcasing the capabilities of markdown

    ## Background

    First off lets start with my background, I switched to computer science this  
    semester after being an English Education major for awhile. Over spring break I  
    finally accepted the fact that I no longer wanted to be a teacher (way to late in  
    my opinion) and decided to go into CS because I always had a knack with computers  
    and in highschool I did well in my classes with the subject.
